# Product Intent

- Build reliable UDM automation using `node + playwright` in a BHVR monorepo (`server`, `client`, `shared`, `automation`).
- Keep runtime behavior observable through structured logs and reporter events.
- Prioritize correctness, recoverability, and maintainability over speed hacks.

## Outcomes we optimize for

- Stable automation runs with clear failure diagnostics.
- Contract-safe changes across all layers.
- Fast onboarding for new contributors and AI agents.
- Production-safe defaults and predictable behavior.
